.. note::

	As of this time aiogtrans is still being rewritten. No documentation will be provided.

	You can check `googletrans <https://py-googletrans.rtfd.io>`__ for complete documentation. This library is 
	more of less the same, instead though, use await in front of translate and detect methods.
